## Setup

> Setting up MySQL 5.7 can be a bit tricky. I'll update very soon with a detailed guide in this section.
- Download and install vagrant and virtualbox
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Run `vagrant up` to start the virtual machine. Ensure you are in the project directory where the `Vagrantfile` is located.
- Run `vagrant ssh` to connect to the virtual machine.
- Install MySQL 5.7 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using the installation script provided in the repository. Run `./install_mysql5.bash` to install MySQL 5.7
- Once the installation is complete, you can connect to the MySQL server using the command `sudo service mysql start`.
